- name: Massage and Treatment
  faqs:
    - question: Is a sports massage painful?
      answer: >
        Sports massage can involve deep tissue techniques, which may cause mild discomfort,
        especially if you have tight muscles. However, pressure is always adjusted to your comfort level
        and will ease over the course of the massage.

        Loose clothing or sportswear is ideal. For deeper work, you may be asked to remove clothing,

        Yes! Sports massage can aid recovery from pains, strains, sprains, and other soft tissue injuries.

        The frequency depends on your activity level and tightness. Most commonly, people begin weekly or bi-weekly
        before moving on to monthly or bi-monthly maintenance treatments. This is determined by the severity of symptoms.
        Please reach out and we can outline an initial treatment plan.
