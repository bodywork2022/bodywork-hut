Prefer a studio setting? You can also find us at R1SE, a popular wellness space in Kelham Island Sheffield.

We’re available there every Monday and Thursday, offering treatment in a calm and professional environment focused on your recovery and wellbeing.

At R1SE, you can also combine your massage with powerful recovery options including:

* Fire and Ice (sauna and ice baths)
* Compression therapy
* Red light therapy


Not sure which option is right for you? We recommend trying compression therapy - it pairs really well with massage and is a great all round choice to support recovery and pain relief.
