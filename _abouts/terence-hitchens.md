Hi I am Terence, a sports massage therapist and owner of Bodywork Hut. I have a vast range of experience with high level athletes, hyrox competitors, footballers and bodybuilders.

That does not mean sports massage is just for athletes.....far from it! I specialise in helping people with their everyday pain, whether that is lower back pain from driving, hip pain while jogging or a shoulder pain when you wake up, I can help.
